            <h1 class="conteudo-principal-escrito-titulo">Who am I?</h1>
                <p class="conteudo-principal-escrito-subtitulo">My name is João Paulo, and I am a master's student in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora - UFJF. As an academic, I will
                share a bit about "why did I choose pharmaceutical sciences?" Well, I like to think that it was the pharmaceutical sciences that chose me, perhaps
                it is due to the scientific curiosity I have had since childhood.</p>
                <p class="conteudo-principal-escrito-subtitulo">A curiosity that motivated me to learn about small things,
                like atoms, for example; though they are so small, they are grandiose when seen from a different perspective. Or perhaps the reason goes far beyond my enthusiasm and fascination in wanting to discover and understand the
                chemical and biological experiments that are part of life.</p>
                <p class="conteudo-principal-escrito-subtitulo">The lessons that my teachers have stimulated me to
                understand - to not falter at the first difficulty and to forsake change, make it worth every sleepless night,
                that I have had and will have ahead, so that “I,” <em>the astute scientist</em>, can face risks with great
                responsibilities. And consequently, I can have valuable new experiences in this pharmaceutical universe. A universe
                filled with possibilities that only benefits those who are part of it.</p>
